# Connect-4
PA9 Final, game based on connect 4.

*Make sure to run the game in release mode x64*

This project was made by the 4 connected members, 
Lucas [Lab Section 11] |
Logan [Lab Section 11] |
Quentin [Lab Section 11] | 
Nathan [Lab Section 10] |

Our team has been working around the clock, 
day in and night out for over a month, 
trying to bring you the best game we can.

The rules of the game are simple, connect 4 balls/tokens in a row, 
diagonally, horizonatally, or vertically to win, if the board is filled
with tokens without 4 in a row of any color, it is a draw.
